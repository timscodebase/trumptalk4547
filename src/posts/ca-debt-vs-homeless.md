**Spending Overview** — California has spent approximately $24 billion on homelessness since 2019, aiming to address the growing crisis.

**Lack of Tracking** — A major issue identified is the lack of consistent tracking and evaluation of the spending's effectiveness, as highlighted by a state audit.

**Costly Housing Solutions** — Some housing projects for the homeless are extremely expensive, with costs exceeding $1 million per unit, which is not sustainable.

**Data Deficiency** — The California Interagency Council on Homelessness has failed to collect and verify accurate data, hindering effective policy-making.
