## No Criminal Record

A significant portion of those detained by ICE have no criminal record. Specifically, 60.1% of ICE detainees, or 22,471 individuals, have no criminal history. This statistic underscores the diverse nature of the population held in detention, which includes many individuals without prior criminal convictions.

## August 2024 Bookings

## State with Most Detainees

Texas has the highest number of ICE detainees, with 11,641 individuals held in the state. This concentration reflects Texas's significant role in U.S. immigration enforcement due to its geographic location and population.

## Arrests

In August 2024, ICE arrested 8,188 individuals. Additionally, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) arrested 16,508 individuals during the same period. These arrest figures illustrate the enforcement activities carried out by both agencies as part of their immigration control efforts.

## Historical Data on Arrests

The Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) division of ICE most commonly arrests individuals with convictions involving DUI, drug possession, assault, and criminal traffic offenses. This historical data provides insight into the types of criminal offenses that are prevalent among those apprehended by ICE.

## Country of Citizenship

ICE arrests are categorized by country of citizenship and criminal history, including those with U.S. criminal convictions and pending charges. This breakdown helps in understanding the demographics and legal status of individuals targeted by enforcement actions.
