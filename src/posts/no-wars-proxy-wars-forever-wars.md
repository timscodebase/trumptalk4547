## No New Wars

During Donald Trump's first term as President of the United States, one notable aspect of his foreign policy was his avoidance of starting any new wars. This sets him apart from several predecessors, as maintaining a non-interventionist stance in terms of initiating conflicts is a significant deviation in modern U.S. history. However, Trump is not alone in this respect; other modern presidents, such as Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, and Richard Nixon, also did not start new wars during their terms.

While Trump refrained from launching new military conflicts, his administration did escalate existing ones. For instance, there was a notable increase in airstrikes in Afghanistan, and his administration provided substantial support to the Saudi-led war in Yemen. These actions highlighted a complex approach to military engagement, where new conflicts were avoided but existing ones were intensified.

Trump's tenure also witnessed several near-misses regarding potential new conflicts. The most prominent of these were with North Korea and Iran, where tensions reached significant heights but ultimately did not result in full-scale wars. Despite these close calls, Trump frequently touted his record of not starting new wars, using it as a point of pride in his farewell address and other public statements.

## US Proxy Wars Involving Israel and Gaza

The United States has long been involved in various proxy wars, including the ongoing conflict in Gaza. U.S. involvement has primarily come through substantial military and political support for Israel. This support has positioned the U.S. as a key player in the region, influencing the dynamics of the conflict significantly.

On the other side, Iran, along with its proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas, has played a significant role in opposing U.S. and Israeli interests in Gaza. This involvement has contributed to a cycle of escalation, with various regional actors, including Iran, the U.S., and their respective allies, continually intensifying the conflict.

Recent events have further complicated the situation. Since October 7, 2023, the war in Gaza has intensified dramatically, leading to significant regional implications. The increased attacks on U.S. and Israeli targets by Iranian proxies have underscored the volatile nature of the conflict. This escalation has not only affected international relations but has also had a domestic impact in the U.S. The conflict has become a contentious issue, particularly on college campuses, where pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups have frequently clashed.

## Key Aspects and Impacts of US 'Forever Wars'
The term 'forever wars' refers to the prolonged and seemingly indefinite military engagements that the U.S. has been involved in since the early 2000s. A significant factor in these ongoing conflicts is the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed in 2001 and 2002. These AUMFs gave the U.S. president broad authority to wage war against perceived enemies, leading to extended military actions without clear endpoints.

The financial cost of these wars has been staggering. For example, the Afghanistan War alone has cost over $2.6 trillion, placing a significant burden on the U.S. economy. Beyond the financial implications, the human cost has been profound. These wars have resulted in substantial civilian casualties, and thousands of U.S. troops have been killed, wounded, or left traumatized.

The global impact of these 'forever wars' is far-reaching, affecting international relations and global security. The U.S.'s prolonged military presence in various regions has reshaped geopolitical landscapes and influenced the policies of numerous countries. The indefinite nature of these conflicts has led to a state of perpetual warfare, with no clear end in sight, highlighting the complex and enduring challenges of U.S. military engagement on the global stage.
